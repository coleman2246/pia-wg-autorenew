# pia-wg-autorenew
PIA's wireguard implementation invalidates wireguard certificates after a few hour of not being used. Just a little script I setup to automatically renew wireguard certificates every set amount of time.
If you wish to find a list of avalible regions you can find them in the github linked at the bottom of this readme.
